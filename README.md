# What is this about?
This is a personal project that is created to learn the game dev process as a solo contributer using Unity Engine. The goal is to complete the game with a stretch goal of possibly publishing it as an unlisted app on the Google Play store.

# What kind of game are you making?
You play as a snake whose main purpose is to kill all enemies on the screen by building offensive/defensive structures on its body parts.
