# What is this about?
This is a personal project that is created to learn the game dev (gameplay programming, AI programming, audio design, 2d art and animation) process as a solo contributer using Unity Engine. The goal is to complete developing the game and make it available on PC. A stretch goal is to publish it as an unlisted app on the Google Play store.

# What kind of game are you making?
You play as a snake whose main purpose is to kill all enemies on the screen by building offensive/defensive structures on its body parts.
